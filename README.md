# Global Food Prices

**A Study of Global Food Prices**

Not really sure what I'm going to do here yet, but I found [this dataset](http://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#data/PP/metadata) from FAOSTAT (a UN subsidiary) with the following description:

> Producer Prices are prices received by farmers for primary crops, live animals and livestock primary products as collected at the point of initial sale (prices paid at the farm-gate). Due to differences in data collection infrastructure and capacity, some countries do vary from this concept by collecting, instead, wholesale or local market prices. While these may be good proxies of farm-gate prices when the marketing chain is very limited, they tend to be poorer proxies in economies where transport and commercial margins constitute a significant share of the final product price. At the far extreme, some countries report retail prices, which are typically very poor proxies for producer prices.





I also found [this dataset](https://data.humdata.org/dataset/wfp-food-prices) from the World Food Program with the following description:

> This dataset contains Global Food Prices data from the World Food Programme covering foods such as maize, rice, beans, fish, and sugar for 76 countries and some 1,500 markets. It is updated weekly but contains to a large extent monthly data. The data goes back as far as 1992 for a few countries, although many countries started reporting from 2003 or thereafter.


Seems cool
